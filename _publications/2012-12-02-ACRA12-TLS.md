### Abstract

Optic flow  has  proven  itself  to  be  a  powerful sensor modality for a wide range of robotic applications.  The most popular optic flow algorithms, however, still tend to be based on classical  algorithms  developed  in  the  era  of  analog video systems.  In this work we reconsider the foundations of optic flow computation for robotic applications from a modern statistical and computer hardware point of view.  We assume  that  high  speed  digital  camera  systems and inertial image compensation are used to reduce the problem to computing sub pixel flow and consider algorithms with the potential to be  implemented  on  FPGA  computing  hardware. In this paper  we  propose  a novel flow algorithm,  based  on  a  combined  least-squares and coupled generalized-total-least-squares optimization  procedure  that  yields  high  quality flow  estimates  for  acceptable  computational load.
