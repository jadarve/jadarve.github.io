It supports programming languages such as Go, C++, Java, and Python, through the use of rule systems for each of them. Rules are stored in repositories (git, http archives) and are downloaded on-demand when they are referenced.
I use Bazel as the build system for my lluvia project. I use C++ as the core language of the project, Python for creating easy to use wrappers for prototyping, Lua for describing compute stages, and finally, GLSL for coding compute shaders that run on the GPU.</description></item><item><title>Today I learned</title><link>https://jadarve.github.io/posts/today-i-learned/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jadarve.github.io/posts/today-i-learned/</guid><description/></item></channel></rss>
